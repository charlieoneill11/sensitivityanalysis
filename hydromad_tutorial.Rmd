Load the required package and Cotter dam data.

```{r}
library(hydromad)
data(Cotter)
```

We can plot the raw daily time series using `xyplot`:
```{r}
xyplot(Cotter)
```
We can also plot the time series aggregated to a monthly time step:
```{r}
monthlyPQE <- aggregate(Cotter, as.yearmon, mean)
xyplot(monthlyPQE, screens = c("Streamflow (mm/day)",
                               "Areal rain (mm/day)", "Temperature (deg. C)"),
       xlab = NULL)
```
One measure that is of key interest in hydrology is the _runoff ratio_, the 
proportion of the rainfall which flows out of the catchment. In a simple case this is just `sum(Q) / sum(P)`, but as we have missing values, we should only compare
the common observations:
```{r}
ok <- complete.cases(Cotter[, 1:2])
with(Cotter, sum(Q[ok])/sum(P[ok]))
```
This figure is within the range we would expect, so is looks like we
probably have the right data series and units.
